The entanglement of formation of a mixed state is defined as the minimum average entanglement of an ensemble of pure states that represents the given mixed state. An earlier paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 5022 (1997)] conjectured an explicit formula for the entanglement of formation of a pair of binary quantum objects (qubits) as a function of their density matrix, and proved the formula to be true for a special class of mixed states. The present paper extends the proof to arbitrary states of this system and shows how to construct entanglement-minimizing pure-state decompositions.},

	abstract = {The bond-dependent Kitaev model offers a playground in which one can search for quantum spin liquids. In these Kitaev materials, a symmetric off-diagonal \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ term emerges, hosting a number of remarkable features, which has been particularly challenging to fully understand. One primary question that arises after recognizing a new phase is how information will spread in it. Out-of-time-ordered commutators and entanglement entropy describe processes whereby information about the initial condition of a unitarily evolving system propagates over the system. A possible way to investigate dynamics in such systems is by considering one-dimensional models. We investigate here the one-dimensional spin-1/2 XY model in a transverse field with a \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ interaction with periodic boundary conditions imposed. We will show that the \${\textbackslash}Gamma\$ interaction constructs an asymmetric "light-cone" with different butterfly velocities. In addition, it leads to faster information propagation in the spiral phase and slower propagation in the ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases. Interestingly, we observe a pronounced effect in the entanglement entropy, explicitly showing up as a two-stage linear growth in time as fast/slow then slow/fast for quenches originating from the spiral phase. We hope our work paves the way for studying more about the spreading of information in one-dimensional Kitaev materials, which can in turn help to discover unknown aspects of higher-dimensional models.},

	abstract = {Cryptography is ubiquitous and plays a key role in ensuring data secrecy and integrity as well as in securing computer systems more broadly. Introduction to Modern Cryptography provides a rigorous yet accessible treatment of this fascinating subject.  The authors introduce the core principles of modern cryptography, with an emphasis on formal definitions, clear assumptions, and rigorous proofs of security. The book begins by focusing on private-key cryptography, including an extensive treatment of private-key encryption, message authentication codes, and hash functions. The authors also present design principles for widely used stream ciphers and block ciphers including RC4, DES, and AES, plus provide provable constructions of stream ciphers and block ciphers from lower-level primitives. The second half of the book covers public-key cryptography, beginning with a self-contained introduction to the number theory needed to understand the RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and El Gamal cryptosystems (and others), followed by a thorough treatment of several standardized public-key encryption and digital signature schemes.  Integrating a more practical perspective without sacrificing rigor, this widely anticipated Second Edition offers improved treatment of:  Stream ciphers and block ciphers, including modes of operation and design principles Authenticated encryption and secure communication sessions Hash functions, including hash-function applications and design principles  Attacks on poorly implemented cryptography, including attacks on chained-CBC encryption, padding-oracle attacks, and timing attacks The random-oracle model and its application to several standardized, widely used public-key encryption and signature schemes Elliptic-curve cryptography and associated standards such as DSA/ECDSA and DHIES/ECIES Containing updated exercises and worked examples, Introduction to Modern Cryptography, Second Edition can serve as a textbook for undergraduate- or graduate-level courses in cryptography, a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners, or a general introduction suitable for self-study.},

This novel approach reveals the physical reason for the asymmetric stability of the Kitaev spin liquid phases around the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Kitaev limits. Moreover, we demonstrate that the fractionalized excitations form bound states in specific regions of each Kitaev spin liquid phase and that certain phase transitions induced by Heisenberg and Gamma interactions are driven by the condensation of such a bound state. Remarkably, this bound state appears as a sharp mode in the dynamical spin structure factor, while its condensation patterns at the appropriate phase transitions provide a simple explanation for the magnetically ordered phases surrounding each Kitaev spin liquid phase.},

The QMOs consist of six atomic orbitals on an Ir hexagon, but each Ir atom belongs to three different QMOs. The concept of such QMOs in solids invokes very different physics compared to the models considered previously. Employing density functional theory calculations and model considerations we find that both the insulating behavior and the experimentally observed zigzag antiferromagnetism in Na2IrO3 naturally follow from the QMO model.},

However, structural clarification of the compound has not been completed, which is crucial in understanding the physics of this system. Here, using \{{\textbackslash}it ab-initio\} electronic structure calculations, we study a full three dimensional (3D) structure of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-RuCl\$\_3\$ including the effects of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and electronic correlations. Three major results are as follows; i) SOC suppresses dimerization of Ru atoms, which exists in other Ru compounds such as isostructural Li\$\_2\$RuO\$\_3\$, and making the honeycomb closer to an ideal one. ii) The nearest-neighbor Kitaev exchange interaction between the \$j\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$=1/2 pseudospin depends strongly on the Ru-Ru distance and the Cl position, originating from the nature of the edge-sharing geometry. iii) The optimized 3D structure without electronic correlations has \$P\{{\textbackslash}bar 3\}1m\$ space group symmetry independent of SOC, but including electronic correlation changes the optimized 3D structure to either \$C2/m\$ or \$Cmc2\_1\$ within 0.1 meV per formula unit (f.u.) energy difference. The reported \$P3\_112\$ structure is also close in energy. The interlayer spin exchange coupling is a few percent of in-plane spin exchange terms, confirming \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-RuCl\$\_3\$ is close to a 2D system. We further suggest how to increase the Kitaev term via tensile strain, which sheds new light in realizing Kitaev spin liquid phase in this system.},

Then the subsets \${\textbackslash}\{I\_a{\textbackslash}\}\$ are just the entanglement islands of the corresponding subsets \${\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{R\}\_a{\textbackslash}\}\$. We call such a system self-encoded, and find that the entanglement entropy in such systems should be calculated by a new island formula. We give a comparison between our new island formula and island formula in gravitational theories.

	abstract = {All our former experience with application of quantum theory seems to say: \{{\textbackslash}it what is predicted by quantum formalism must occur in laboratory\}. But the essence of quantum formalism - entanglement, recognized by Einstein, Podolsky, Rosen and Schr{\textbackslash}"odinger - waited over 70 years to enter to laboratories as a new resource as real as energy. This holistic property of compound quantum systems, which involves nonclassical correlations between subsystems, is a potential for many quantum processes, including ``canonical'' ones: quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation and dense coding. However, it appeared that this new resource is very complex and difficult to detect. Being usually fragile to environment, it is robust against conceptual and mathematical tools, the task of which is to decipher its rich structure. This article reviews basic aspects of entanglement including its characterization, detection, distillation and quantifying. In particular, the authors discuss various manifestations of entanglement via Bell inequalities, entropic inequalities, entanglement witnesses, quantum cryptography and point out some interrelations. They also discuss a basic role of entanglement in quantum communication within distant labs paradigm and stress some peculiarities such as irreversibility of entanglement manipulations including its extremal form - bound entanglement phenomenon. A basic role of entanglement witnesses in detection of entanglement is emphasized.},

Novel theoretical protocols are designed on a regular basis, security proofs are constantly improving, and experiments are gradually moving from proof-of-principle lab demonstrations to in-field implementations and technological prototypes. In this review, we provide both a general introduction and a state of the art description of the recent advances in the field, both theoretically and experimentally. We start by reviewing protocols of quantum key distribution based on discrete variable systems. Next we consider aspects of device independence, satellite challenges, and high rate protocols based on continuous variable systems. We will then discuss the ultimate limits of point-to-point private communications and how quantum repeaters and networks may overcome these restrictions. Finally, we will discuss some aspects of quantum cryptography beyond standard quantum key distribution, including quantum data locking and quantum digital signatures.},

Their orders of magnitudes are estimated to be (𝛥⁢𝑔𝑔) and (𝛥⁢𝑔𝑔)2 times the isotropic superexchange energy, respectively. Higher order spin couplings are also discussed. As an example of antisymmetric spin coupling the case of CuCl2·2H2O is illustrated. In CuCl2·2H2O, a spin arrangement which is different from one accepted so far is proposed. This antisymmetric interaction is shown to be responsible for weak ferromagnetism in 𝛼-Fe2O3, MnCO3, and CrF3. The paramagnetic susceptibility perpendicular to the trigonal axis is expected to increase very sharply near the Néel temperature as the temperature is lowered, as was actually observed in CrF3.},

We introduce anyons at the system-independent level of anyon models and discuss the key concepts of protected fusion spaces and statistical quantum evolutions for encoding and processing quantum information. Both the encoding and the processing are inherently resilient against errors due to their topological nature, thus promising to overcome one of the main obstacles for the realisation of quantum computers. We outline the general steps of topological quantum computation, as well as discuss various challenges faced by it. We also review the literature on condensed matter systems where anyons can emerge. Finally, the appearance of anyons and employing them for quantum computation is demonstrated in the context of a simple microscopic model -- the topological superconducting nanowire -- that describes the low-energy physics of several experimentally relevant settings. This model supports localised Majorana zero modes that are the simplest and the experimentally most tractable types of anyons that are needed to perform topological quantum computation.},

First we present the exact solution of Kitaev model using Majorana fermionisation and elaborate in detail the \$Z\_2\$ gauge structure. Following this we discuss exact calculation of magnetization, spin-spin correlation function establishing its spin-liquid character. Spin fractionalization and de-confinement of Majorana fermion is explained in detail.

Quantum simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also with simpler, analog devices that would require less control, and therefore, would be easier to construct. A number of quantum systems such as neutral atoms, ions, polar molecules, electrons in semiconductors, superconducting circuits, nuclear spins and photons have been proposed as quantum simulators.

One of the phases has an energy gap and carries excitations that are Abelian anyons. The other phase is gapless, but acquires a gap in the presence of magnetic field. In the latter case excitations are non-Abelian anyons whose braiding rules coincide with those of conformal blocks for the Ising model. We also consider a general theory of free fermions with a gapped spectrum, which is characterized by a spectral Chern number \${\textbackslash}nu\$. The Abelian and non-Abelian phases of the original model correspond to \${\textbackslash}nu=0\$ and \${\textbackslash}nu={\textbackslash}pm 1\$, respectively. The anyonic properties of excitation depend on \${\textbackslash}nu{\textbackslash}bmod 16\$, whereas \${\textbackslash}nu\$ itself governs edge thermal transport.

The Hilbert space breaks up in blocks characterized by the quantum numbers of the total spin, S and M, and each block is shown to constitute the representation space of an explicitly given irreducible representation of the symmetric group 𝑆𝑁, consisting of permutations of the N spins in the system. In the second part of the paper we consider, as a concrete application, the model where each spin is coupled to all the other spins with equal strength. Its partition function is written as a single integral, elucidating its N dependence. This provides a useful framework for studying finite-size effects.

	abstract = {This thesis takes inspiration from quantum physics to investigate mathematical structure that lies at the interface of algebra and statistics. The starting point is a passage from classical probability theory to quantum probability theory. The quantum version of a probability distribution is a density operator, the quantum version of marginalizing is an operation called the partial trace, and the quantum version of a marginal probability distribution is a reduced density operator. Every joint probability distribution on a finite set can be modeled as a rank one density operator. By applying the partial trace, we obtain reduced density operators whose diagonals recover classical marginal probabilities. In general, these reduced densities will have rank higher than one, and their eigenvalues and eigenvectors will contain extra information that encodes subsystem interactions governed by statistics. We decode this information, and show it is akin to conditional probability, and then investigate the extent to which the eigenvectors capture "concepts" inherent in the original joint distribution. The theory is then illustrated with an experiment that exploits these ideas. Turning to a more theoretical application, we also discuss a preliminary framework for modeling entailment and concept hierarchy in natural language, namely, by representing expressions in the language as densities. Finally, initial inspiration for this thesis comes from formal concept analysis, which finds many striking parallels with the linear algebra. The parallels are not coincidental, and a common blueprint is found in category theory. We close with an exposition on free (co)completions and how the free-forgetful adjunctions in which they arise strongly suggest that in certain categorical contexts, the "fixed points" of a morphism with its adjoint encode interesting information.},
